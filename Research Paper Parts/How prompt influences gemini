CLAUDE:
"Although this behavior is not formally documented as a Gemini-specific property, it represents a consistent empirical pattern in our experiments that aligns with 
fundamental architectural characteristics of transformer-based language models. At their core, LLMs are trained via next-token prediction on text corpora, optimizing 
for coherent narrative generation rather than procedural execution or state management. They lack native constructs for workflow control—no built-in state machines, 
execution gates, or completion verification mechanisms exist within the transformer architecture. Consequently, when presented with phase-based instructions, 
the model processes them through its primary competency: generating plausible, coherent text that describes a phased workflow rather than enforcing it as a series 
of state-dependent operations.
In our experiments with phase-based prompts, Gemini correctly recognizes operational phases and articulates what actions should occur in each phase, but treats phase transitions as narrative milestones rather than enforceable execution constraints. The model's attention mechanism and autoregressive generation process naturally optimize for procedural completeness and explanatory coherence—producing responses that sound thorough and well-structured—rather than strictly gating progress on verified system-level state transitions. Because transformers maintain context through self-attention over the conversation history rather than through explicit state variables, there's no architectural mechanism to enforce "Phase 2 cannot begin until Phase 1 completion is verified." The model simply generates the next plausible continuation of the conversation, which includes statements like "Now proceeding to Phase 2," whether or not Phase 1 was genuinely complete.
This contrasts sharply with task-based prompts, where remediation steps are tied to explicit system state changes and verification. Each task produces an observable effect (e.g., 'Defender enabled' vs. 'Defender disabled'), creating natural completion criteria that don't rely on the model's self-assessment. The distinction illustrates that capability-centric prompts more reliably anchor actions to observable effects because they externalize verification—the system state itself determines task completion—whereas phase-oriented prompts depend on the model's internal (and architecturally unsupported) judgment of when a phase is 'complete.' In essence, task-based prompts align with what transformers do well (mapping inputs to actions), while phase-based prompts require capabilities (stateful workflow enforcement) that the architecture was not designed to provide.
This finding has significant implications for agentic AI system design: reliable agent behavior emerges not from complex procedural instructions, but from prompts that align with the model's architectural strengths—immediate stimulus-response patterns, atomic verifiable tasks, and state verification through external observation rather than internal reasoning."
