# Effectiveness of Large Language Models for Incident Response on Windows Operating Systems

## Purpose

With the ever-increasing use of large language models in everyday life, it has increasingly become a point of interest whether or not the use of such models could be utilized in the field of cybersecurity. Despite the wide range of possibilities artificial intelligence can be applied to in the expansive sphere of cybersecurity, this project aims to investigate the effectiveness of large language models when it comes to incident response in the aftermath of cyber attacks, specifically in the scope of Windows operating systems. The goal is to test the capabilities of different artificial intelligence models in terms of their feasibility as an automated tool for the attack response and remediation of Windows operating systems, specifically in cases where the response to a cyber attack of multiple independent systems must be done quickly and effectively.
