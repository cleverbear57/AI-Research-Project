# Effectiveness of Large Language Models for Incident Response on Windows Operating Systems

## Purpose

With the ever-increasing use of large language models in everyday life, it has increasingly been a point of interest whether or not the use of such models could be utilized in the field of cybersecurity. Despite the wide range of possibilities artificial intelligence could be applied to in the expansive sphere of cybersecurity, this project aims to investigate the effectiveness of large language models when it comes to remediating cyber attacks, specifically on Windows operating systems. The goal is to test the capabilities of artificial intelligence towards the feasibility of its use as an automated tool for the remediation of Windows operating systems in cases where the remediation of multiple independent systems must be done quickly and effectively.
